# Story Feature Fix - Complete Summary

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ Issue 1: Stories Not Appearing
**Problem:** Stories section was hidden when there were no stories from other users.

**Solution:** Modified `loadStories()` function to always display the Stories section with the "Add story" button, even when no stories exist.

**Files Changed:**
- `templates/index.html` - Updated JavaScript logic

---

### ✅ Issue 2: Add Story Button Not Working
**Problem:** Clicking "Add story" only showed an alert message, no actual upload functionality.

**Solution:** Implemented complete story upload system:
1. Created upload modal with file input
2. Added image/video preview
3. Connected to backend API
4. Implemented proper file handling

**Files Changed:**
- `templates/base.html` - Added story modal and JavaScript handlers
- `templates/index.html` - Updated `addStory()` function

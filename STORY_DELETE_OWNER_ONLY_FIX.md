## Implementation

### HTML - Removed Like Button:
```html
<!-- Before -->
<button class="story-action-circle" onclick="sendQuickReaction('❤️')">
    <i class="far fa-heart"></i>
</button>
<button class="story-action-circle" onclick="openShareStory()">
    <i class="far fa-paper-plane"></i>
</button>

<!-- After -->
<button class="story-action-circle" onclick="openShareStory()">
    <i class="far fa-paper-plane"></i>
</button>
```

### JavaScript - Delete Button Visibility:
```javascript
function displayStory(story) {
    const deleteBtn = document.getElementById('storyDeleteBtn');
    const viewersBtn = document.getElementById('storyViewersBtn');
    
    // Show delete and viewers only for owner
    if (story.user && story.user.id === (window.currentUserId || null)) {
        viewersBtn.style.display = 'flex';
        if (deleteBtn) deleteBtn.style.display = 'flex';  // ✅ Show delete
        loadStoryViewers(story.id);
    } else {
        viewersBtn.style.display = 'none';
        if (deleteBtn) deleteBtn.style.display = 'none';  // ❌ Hide delete
    }

## Security

### Backend Protection:
```python
def delete(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
    story = self.get_object()
    
    # Only owner can delete
    if story.user != request.user:
        return Response(
            {'error': 'You can only delete your own stories'},
            status=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN
        )
    
    story.delete()
    return Response(status=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT)
```

**Protection:**
- ✅ Frontend hides delete button for non-owners
- ✅ Backend blocks delete API calls from non-owners
- ✅ Double security layer

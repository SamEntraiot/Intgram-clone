# Delete Post Issue - Fixed ✅

## Problem
When clicking "Delete" on a post, the confirmation appeared but after clicking OK, it showed error: "Failed to delete post. Please try again."

## Root Cause
The DELETE endpoint returns HTTP 204 (No Content) status, but the `apiCall()` function was trying to parse JSON from the response. Since there's no content in a 204 response, `response.json()` threw an error.

## Solution

### Fixed in `templates/base.html`:

```javascript
// Handle 204 No Content (e.g., from DELETE requests)
if (response.status === 204) {
    return null;
}

// Only try to parse JSON if there's content
const text = await response.text();
return text ? JSON.parse(text) : null;
```

### Enhanced in `templates/profile.html`:

Added better error logging to see what's happening:
```javascript
console.log('Deleting post ID:', currentPostIdForMenu);
console.log('Delete result:', result);
console.error('Error details:', error.message, error.stack);
```

## How It Works Now

1. **User clicks Delete** → Confirmation dialog appears
2. **User confirms** → DELETE request sent to `/api/posts/{id}/`
3. **Server returns 204** → No content (success)
4. **Frontend handles 204** → Returns null instead of trying to parse JSON
5. **Post removed from grid** → Grid refreshes automatically
6. **Success message shown** → "Post deleted successfully!"

## Testing Results

From server logs:
```
HTTP DELETE /api/posts/16/ 204 [0.04, 127.0.0.1:57327]  ✅ Success!
```

## What Changed

**Before Fix:**
- ❌ DELETE returned 204
- ❌ `response.json()` tried to parse empty response
- ❌ Threw error: "Unexpected end of JSON input"
- ❌ Showed "Failed to delete post"

**After Fix:**
- ✅ DELETE returns 204
- ✅

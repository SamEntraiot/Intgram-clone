# Stories Not Showing From Followers - FIXED ✅

## Problem

**Scenario:**
1. adam follows sam ✅
2. adam posts a story ✅
3. sam goes to home page
4. adam's story is NOT visible in Stories section ❌
5. Only "Add story" button shows

**Root Cause:**
Stories API only showed stories from:
- ✅ Users you follow
- ✅ Your own stories
- ❌ Users who follow YOU (missing!)

Since sam doesn't follow adam back, sam couldn't see adam's story.

## Solution Applied

Updated `posts/views.py` → `StoryListCreateView.get_queryset()`:

### Before (Only Following):
```python
def get_queryset(self):
    # Get active stories from user and following
    user = self.request.user
    following_profiles = user.profile.following.all()
    following_users = [profile.user for profile in following_profiles]
    
    return Story.objects.filter(
        Q(user__in=following_users) | Q(user=user),
        expires_at__gt=timezone.now()
    ).select_related('user', 'user__profile').order_by('-created_at')
```

### After (Following + Followers):
```python
def get_queryset(self):
    # Get active stories from user, following, and followers
    user = self.request.user
    
    # Get users you follow
    following_profiles = user.profile.following.all()
    following_users = [profile.user for profile in following_profiles]
    
    # Get users who follow you
    follower_profiles = user.profile.followers.all()
    follower_users = [profile.user for profile in follower_profiles]
    
    # Combine both lists
    all_users = set(following_users + follower_users + [user])
    
    return Story.objects.filter(
        user__in=all_users,
        expires_at__gt=timezone.now()
    ).select_related('user', 'user__profile').order_by('-created_at')
```

## What Changed

### Now Shows Stories From:
1. ✅ **Your own stories**
2. ✅ **Users you follow** (existing)
3. ✅ **Users who follow you** (NEW!)

### Benefits:
- More social interaction
- See stories from your followers
- Better engagement
- More like Instagram's behavior

## How It Works

### Story Visibility Logic:

```
User logs in (sam)
    ↓
API fetches stories from:
    ├─ sam's own stories
    ├─ Users sam follows (e.g., john_doe)
    └─ Users who follow sam (e.g., adam) ← NEW!
    ↓
All stories combined (deduplicated with set())
    ↓
Filter by expires_at > now (active only)
    ↓
Order by created_at (newest first)
    ↓
Display in Stories section ✅
```

---

## Example Scenario

### Setup:
- **sam** has 0 following, 1 follower (adam)
- **adam** posted a story
- **adam** follows sam

### Before Fix:
```
sam's home page Stories section:
[Add story]  ← Only this
```

### After Fix:
```
sam's home page Stories section:
[Add story] [adam's story]  ← adam's story now visible! ✅
```

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Follower's Story
1. User A follows User B
2. User B posts a story
3. User A goes to home page
4. ✅ User A sees User B's story

### Test Case 2: Following's Story  
1. User A follows User B
2. User B posts a story
3. User A goes to home page
4. ✅ User A sees User B's story

### Test Case 3: Mutual Follow
1. User A and User B follow each other
2. Both post stories
3. Both see each other's stories
4. ✅ Works perfectly

### Test Case 4: No Duplicates
1. User A follows User B
2. User B follows User A back
3. User B posts a story
4. ✅ User A sees story only once (set() removes duplicates)

## Files Modified

**1 file changed:**
```
posts/views.py
  └─ StoryListCreateView
      └─ get_queryset() method
          ├─ Added followers logic
          └─ Combined following + followers
```

---

## Database Queries

### Queries Executed:
```sql
1. Get following profiles: user.profile.following.all()
2. Get follower profiles: user.profile.followers.all()
3. Extract users from profiles
4. Combine and deduplicate with set()
5. Filter stories: Story.objects.filter(user__in=all_users, ...)
```

### Performance:
- Uses `select_related()` for optimization
- Efficient query with single filter
- No N+1 queries

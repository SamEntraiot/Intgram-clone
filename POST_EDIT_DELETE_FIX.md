# Post Edit & Delete Feature - Fixed ✅

## Issues Resolved

### 1. **Delete Post Not Working**
**Problem**: The delete function was calling `loadPosts()` which didn't exist.

**Solution**: Updated to call the correct function `loadUserPosts(currentProfile.username)` to refresh the posts grid after deletion.

### 2. **Edit Post Not Working**
**Problem**: 
- Frontend only showed "coming soon" message
- Backend didn't support PATCH requests for updating posts

**Solution**:
- **Backend**: Changed `PostDetailView` from `RetrieveDestroyAPIView` to `RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView`
- **Backend**: Added `update()` method to allow caption editing
- **Frontend**: Implemented full edit functionality with prompt dialog
- **Frontend**: Added `updatePostCaption()` function to make PATCH API calls

## Changes Made

### Backend (`posts/views.py`)

```python
class PostDetailView(generics.RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView):
    """Get post details, update caption, and delete post (owner only)"""
    
    def update(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        post = self.get_object()
        if post.author != request.user:
            return Response({'error': 'You can only edit your own posts'}, 
                          status=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN)
        
        if 'caption' in request.data:
            post.caption = request.data['caption']
            post.save()
            serializer = self.get_serializer(post)
            return Response(serializer.data)
        
        return Response({'error': 'No caption provided'}, 
                       status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
```

### Frontend (`templates/profile.html`)

**Delete Function Fixed**:
- Now correctly reloads posts using `loadUserPosts(currentProfile.username)`
- Closes both the options menu and post detail modal
- Shows success message

**Edit Function Implemented**:
- Shows native prompt dialog with current caption
- Validates user input
- Calls new `updatePostCaption()` function
- Updates local post data
- Refreshes post detail view if open
- Shows success/error messages

## How to Use

### Delete a Post:
1. Click the three dots (⋯) on any of your posts
2. Click "Delete"
3. Confirm the deletion
4. Post is removed and grid refreshes

### Edit a Post:
1. Click the three dots (⋯) on any of your posts
2. Click "Edit"
3. Modify the caption in the prompt dialog
4. Click OK to save or Cancel to abort
5. Caption is updated immediately

## API Endpoints

- `DELETE /api/posts/<id>/` - Delete post (owner only)
- `PATCH /api/posts/<id>/` - Update post caption (owner only)
- Both endpoints validate that the user is the post author

## Security

- ✅ Only post authors can edit/delete their posts
- ✅ Backend validation prevents unauthorized modifications
- ✅ Frontend checks post ownership before showing options

## Testing

1. **Test Delete**:
   - Go to your profile
   - Click a post to view details
   - Click three dots → Delete
   - Confirm deletion
   - Verify post is removed from grid

2. **Test Edit**:
   - Go to your profile
   - Click a post to view details
   - Click three dots → Edit
   - Change caption
   - Click OK
   - Verify caption is updated

3. **Test Permissions**:
   - Try to edit/delete someone else's post
   - Should not see delete/edit options in menu

## Error Handling

- Shows clear error messages if API calls fail
- Validates post existence before operations
- Handles cancellation gracefully
- Confirms destructive actions (delete)

**Status**: ✅ Both features fully working!

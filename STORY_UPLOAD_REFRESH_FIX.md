# Story Upload Not Showing - FIXED ✅

## Problem

After uploading a story successfully:
1. ✅ Alert showed: "Story uploaded successfully! It will disappear after 24 hours."
2. ✅ User clicks OK
3. ❌ Story doesn't appear in Stories section
4. ❌ Required full page refresh to see it

## Root Cause

The code was using `location.reload()` which refreshes the entire page, but:
- Alert blocks execution until OK clicked
- Page reload happened after alert
- BUT stories list wasn't being refreshed in index.html

## Solution Applied

### Changed in `templates/base.html`:

**Before (Full Page Reload):**
```javascript
try {
    await apiCall('/stories/', { method: 'POST', body: formData });
    
    closeModal('createStoryModal');
    e.target.reset();
    alert('Story uploaded successfully!...');
    location.reload();  // ❌ Reloads entire page
}
```

**After (Smart Refresh):**
```javascript
try {
    await apiCall('/stories/', { method: 'POST', body: formData });
    
    closeModal('createStoryModal');
    e.target.reset();
    
    // Reload ONLY stories section (no full page reload)
    if (typeof loadStories === 'function') {
        await loadStories();  // ✅ Refreshes stories list
    }
    
    alert('Story uploaded successfully!...');
}
```

### Additional Fix: Video Upload Logic

**Before (Bug):**
```javascript
} else if (file.type.startsWith('video/')) {
    formData.append('video', file);
    alert('Please select a valid image or video file');  // ❌ Wrong!
    return;
}
```

**After (Fixed):**
```javascript
} else if (file.type.startsWith('video/')) {
    formData.append('video', file);  // ✅ Correct
} else {
    alert('Please select a valid image or video file');  // ✅ Only for invalid files
    return;
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Upload Flow:
```
1. User clicks "Create Story"
2. Selects photo/video
3. Clicks "Share Story"
    ↓
4. Story uploads to server ✅
    ↓
5. Modal closes
6. Form resets
    ↓
7. loadStories() called  ← NEW!
    ↓
8. Stories section refreshes
9. New story appears immediately ✅
    ↓
10. Alert shows success message
11. User clicks OK
12. Story is already visible! ✅
```

## Benefits

✅ **No full page reload** - Faster, smoother UX
✅ **Story appears immediately** - Before alert is dismissed  
✅ **Preserves scroll position** - User stays where they were  
✅ **Better performance** - Only updates what's needed

## Testing

### Steps to Test:

2. **Click "Add story"** (+ button)

5. ✅ **Modal closes**
6. ✅ **Stories section updates immediately**
